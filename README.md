# Randomness is the Key!

# Description

Simple game made in Python using the PyGame library. You face off against a randomized PC player to see who can be the one to empty the bags!

# Overview

The game allows you to infinitely retry against the PC Player, each time letting you enter your username which is then displayed when you win.
There is also a 'Info' screen that details the libraries and time taken when creating this game.
